## About

Ensuring mission success for multi-robot systems operating
in unpredictable environments requires robust mechanisms to react to unpredictable events,
such as robot failures, by adapting plans in real-time.
Adaptive mechanisms are especially needed for large teams deployed in areas with unreliable network infrastructure,
for which centralized control is impractical and where network segmentation is frequent.

This work advances the state of the art by proposing a field-based runtime replanning approach grounded in aggregate programming.
Through this paradigm,
the mission and the environment are represented by continuously evolving fields,
enabling robots to make decentralized decisions and collectively adapt the ongoing plan.

We compare our approach with a simple late-stage replanning strategy
and an oracle-supported centralized continuous replanner.
We provide experimental evidence that the proposed approach achieves performance close to the oracle if the communication range is enough,
while significantly outperforming the baseline even under sparse communication.
Additionally, we show that the approach can scale well with the number of robots.

### Experiments

This repository contains the source code for the experiments presented in the paper
"_A Field-based Approach for Runtime Replanning in Swarm Robotics Missions_".

The primary goals of the experiments are:
- **Resilience Assessment**: verify whether the proposed field-based replanning approaches adapt to robot failures, 
    ensuring mission completion despite unforeseen disruptions.
- **Scalability Analysis**: investigate how the number of robots and tasks affect the system performance.

Some snapshots of the experiments are shown below.
Tasks are represented by red dots, which turn green when completed.
Pink lines show robot trajectories,
gray boxes mark inactive/failed robots.
Gray lines show direct communication lines between robots.
See the [Understanding the experiments](#understanding-the-experiments) section for a detailed explanation of the images.

## Getting started

### Requirements

In order to successfully download and execute the graphical experiments are needed:
- Internet connection;
- [Git](https://git-scm.com);
- Linux, macOS and Windows systems capable of running [Java](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk19-archive-downloads.html) 17 (or higher);
- 1GB free space on disk;
- GPU with minimal OpenGL capabilities (OpenGL 2.0);
- 4GB RAM.

The project uses [Gradle](https://gradle.org) as a build tool,
and all the project dependencies are listed in the `gradle\libs.versions.toml` file.

### Limitations

- The experiments run in "batch mode" generate a lot of data,
  and the simulation may take a long time to finish (up to several hours) even with high-performance computers.
  We suggest running the experiments in "graphic mode" to have a better understanding of the simulation;
- On different monitor types with different resolutions, the graphical interface could appear a bit different;
- For GUI interpretation, please refer to the [Simulation Graphical Interface](#simulation-graphical-interface) section.

### Understanding the experiments

The experiments are the following:
- _depotsBaseline_: where the replanning is done at the end of the mission, after each robot has completed its tasks, it has been used for benchmarking;
- _depotsOracle_: the replanning is centralized, there is an oracle that knows the state of the environment and the robots,
  once a node fails, there is a server that replans the mission and sends the new plan to the robots, it has been used for benchmarking;
- _depotsRuntime_: our proposed field-based runtime replanning approach,
  where robots are able to adapt their plan in real-time based on the current state of the environment. 
  This approach has two different types of planning:
    - leader-based: where a leader is elected in a distributed and adaptive way (resilient to failures),
        and is responsible for deciding the plan for all the robots;
    - gossip-based: creates a global state of the system in a distributed way, then replans the mission based on the global state.

The mentioned experiments have just three nodes that fail during the mission,
at different times.

Meanwhile, the ones named with the suffix _RandomFailure_ are the same as the ones without the suffix,
but in addition, every robot has a probability of failure during the mission.
The failure is modeled through a Poisson process,
where each robot is assigned a mean failure time drawn
from an exponential (memoryless) distribution. The mean
of this exponential distribution $(λ^{−1})$ represents the mean
time between failures.

### Walk-through the experiments

This section provides a brief overview of the _depotsRuntime_ experiment with the leader-based planning.
It is executed with the following default parameters:
- $20$ nodes (robots) in the simulation;
- total number of tasks in the environment to complete is $totalNodes * totalTaskFactor$, 
  where `totalTaskFactor` as default is $4$, so the total number of tasks is $80$;
- full communication range (i.e., robots can communicate with all other robots);
- the type of replanning is a default too, which is, in fact, the leader-based planning.

The detailed instructions to reproduce the experiment are in the section "[Reproduce the entire experiment](#reproduce-the-entire-experiment)".

The simulation can be launched with the command `MAX_SEED=0 ./gradlew runDepotsRuntimeGraphic` on a Unix terminal,
or the one in the section "[Extremely quick-start](#extremely-quick-start-of-a-basic-experiment----bazfish-users-only)".
Note that the `MAX_SEED` is a parameter used for batch experiments,
which allows running the experiment with a fixed number of seeds, but it does not affect the graphical experiments.

Once the simulation has started, the Alchemist GUI will open.
Once the simulation starts, the Alchemist GUI will appear.
After Alchemist finishes loading, you will see the initial setup:
the tasks distributed throughout the environment,
and all robots positioned at their common starting point, ready to begin the mission.

For more details of the simulation (e.g., the appearance, the meaning of the different colors, etc.)
see the section [Understanding the experiments](#understanding-the-experiments).
Now the simulation can be started by pressing the <kbd>P</kbd> key on the keyboard.
By pressing the <kbd>P</kbd> key again, the simulation will pause (and resume).
When the simulation starts,
if you wish to execute it at "real time" speed,
press the <kbd>R</kbd> key (and again to return to the fast speed).
For other features of the GUI, please refer to the [Simulation Graphical Interface](#simulation-graphical-interface) section.

As seen in the sequence above, (section [experiments](#experiments)),
the robots start moving towards the red tasks, which are the tasks to complete,
then will turn green once completed.
A task can take a different amount of time to complete, depending on the task type.
Once a robot completes a task, it will continue to the next task,
until all tasks are completed or the robot fails.
If a robot fails, it will stop moving and will not complete any more tasks,
it will be marked as inactive (gray box) in the simulation;
the leader will then replan the mission based on the current state of the environment,
and the robots will adapt their plan accordingly.
It is possible to observe robots moving back and forth to complete tasks until all are finished.
If a leader fails, a new leader will be elected in a distributed way,
and the mission will continue with the new leader.
The path that each robot has taken during the mission is shown in different reddish colors,
based on the id of the robot.

### Reproduce the entire experiment

**WARNING**: re-running the whole experiment may take a very long time on a normal computer.

#### Simulation Graphical Interface

The simulation environment and graphical interface are provided by [Alchemist Simulator](https://alchemistsimulator.github.io/index.html).
To understand how to interact with the GUI,
please refer to the [Alchemist documentation](https://alchemistsimulator.github.io/reference/swing/index.html#shortcuts).

#### Extremely quick-start of a basic experiment -- `(ba|z|fi)?sh` users only

- Requires a Unix terminal (`(ba|z|fi)?sh`)
- `curl` must be installed
- run:
```bash
# leader-based replanning
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/angelacorte/experiments-2025-acsos-robots/master/runtime-replanning-leader-based.sh | bash 
```
```bash
# gossip-based replanning
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/angelacorte/experiments-2025-acsos-robots/master/runtime-replanning-gossip-based.sh | bash
```
- the repository is in your `Downloads` folder for further inspection.

**Note** that this runs the _depotsRuntime_ experiment with the default parameters;
to change them, you need to edit the `depotsRuntime.yaml` file located in the `src/main/yaml` folder,
as will be explained in the section "[Changing experiment's parameters](#changing-experiments-parameters)".

#### Reproduce the experiments through Gradle

1. Install a Gradle-compatible version of Java.
   Use the [Gradle/Java compatibility matrix](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/compatibility.html) to learn which is the compatible version range.
   The Version of Gradle used in this experiment can be found in the gradle-wrapper.properties file located in the gradle/wrapper folder.
2. Open a terminal
3. Clone this repository on your pc with `git clone https://github.com/angelacorte/experiments-2025-acsos-robots`.
4. Move into the root folder with `cd experiments-2025-acsos-robots`
5. Depending on the platform, run the following command:
    - Bash compatible (Linux, Mac OS X, Git Bash, Cygwin): ``` ./gradlew run<ExperimentName>Graphic ```
    - Windows native (cmd.exe, Powershell): ``` gradlew.bat run<ExperimentName>Graphic ```
6. Substitute `<ExperimentName>` with the name of the experiment (in PascalCase) specified in the YAML simulation file.
   Or execute ```./gradlew tasks``` to view the list of available tasks.

**Note** that before each experiment command, it must be set the `MAX_SEED` environment variable to a specific value to run the experiment,
since that parameter is relevant only for batch experiments,
it is suggested to set it to `0` for the graphical experiments.

The corresponding YAML simulation files to the experiments cited above are the following:
- _depotsBaseline_: benchmark experiment, where the replanning is done at the end of each robot's mission ```MAX_SEED=0 ./gradlew runDepotsBaselineGraphic```,
- _depotsBaselineRandomFailure_: benchmark experiment with random failures, where the replanning is done at the end of each robot's mission
  ```MAX_SEED=0 ./gradlew runDepotsBaselineRandomFailureGraphic```,
- _depotsOracle_: benchmark experiment with an oracle that replans the mission in real-time ```MAX_SEED=0 ./gradlew runDepotsOracleGraphic```,
- _depotsOracleRandomFailure_: benchmark experiment with an oracle that replans the mission in real-time and random nodes failures ```MAX_SEED=0 ./gradlew runDepotsOracleRandomFailureGraphic```,
- _depotsRuntime_: our proposed field-based runtime replanning approach with (default) leader-based planning ```MAX_SEED=0 ./gradlew runDepotsRuntimeGraphic```,
    to run it with gossip-based planning instead, the command is ```MAX_SEED=0 LEADER_BASED=false ./gradlew runDepotsRuntimeGraphic```,
- _depotsRuntimeRandomFailure_: our proposed field-based runtime replanning approach with (default) leader-based planning and random nodes failures
  ```MAX_SEED=0 ./gradlew runDepotsRuntimeRandomFailureGraphic```,
    to run it with gossip-based planning instead, the command is ```MAX_SEED=0 LEADER_BASED=false ./gradlew runDepotsRuntimeRandomFailureGraphic```.

**NOTE:**
The tasks above *in graphic mode* will run the experiments with the default parameters.

#### Changing experiment's parameters
To change the parameters of the experiments, you can modify the **YAML** files located in the `src/main/yaml` folder.
The parameters that can be changed are:
- `totalNodes`: the number of nodes in the simulation;
- `totalTaskFactor`: the factor that determines the total number of tasks in the environment;
- `communication`: the communication range of the robots;
- `speed`: the speed of the robots;

In the _runtime_ experiments, you can also change the type of replanning:
`leaderBased`: if set to `true`, the **leader-based** planning is used, false for the **gossip-based** planning.

Each change in the parameters will result in a different setup and execution of the experiment.
The parameters provided in the YAML files are the ones used for the evaluation and the ones evaluated as "optimal."

For further information about the YAML structure,
please refer to the [Alchemist documentation](https://alchemistsimulator.github.io/reference/yaml/index.html).

#### Simulation entrypoint

### Reproduce the experiment results

**WARNING**: re-running the whole experiment may take a very long time on a normal computer.

To collect the data for the analysis and the charts,
the experiments have been run in "batch mode,"
which means that the experiments are run without the graphical interface,
and with different combinations of parameters.

Since to run the experiments in batch mode in a normal computer may take a very long time (e.g., days),
we launched the experiments on a cluster to shorten the time needed to collect the data.
For the sake of simplicity,
we provide the data collected in the experiments at [this link](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Data_for_A_Field-based_Approach_for_Runtime_Replanning_in_Swarm_Robotics_Missions_--_ACSOS_2025/29447825/2?file=55904084).

#### Reproduce the experiments with containers (recommended)

1. Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) and [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/);
2. Run `docker-compose up` in the root folder of the repository:
    this will build the Docker images and run the containers needed to run the experiments.
3. From the `docker-compose.yml` file, you can see that eight separate containers will be created, one for each experiment, and the data will be collected in the `data` folder.
    Note that the `volumes` field has to be updated to match your local environment.

#### Reproduce natively

1. Install a Gradle-compatible version of Java.
  Use the [Gradle/Java compatibility matrix](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/compatibility.html)
  to learn which is the compatible version range.
  The Version of Gradle used in this experiment can be found in the `gradle-wrapper.properties` file
  located in the `gradle/wrapper` folder.
2. Install the version of Python indicated in `.python-version` (or use `pyenv`).
3. Launch either:
    - `./gradlew runAllBatch` on Linux, MacOS, or Windows if a bash-compatible shell is available;
    - `gradlew.bat runAllBatch` on Windows cmd or Powershell;
    **Note** that you will need to set the `MAX_SEED` environment variable to a specific value to run the experiment (e.g., in our experiments, we set it to `31`).
    and the `LEADER_BASED` environment variable to `true` or `false` to choose the type of replanning (leader-based or gossip-based).
4. Once the experiment is finished, the results will be available in the `data` folder.

#### Generate the charts
1. Make sure you have Python 3.10 or higher installed.
2. Install the required Python packages by running:
    ```bash
    pip install --upgrade pip
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. Run the script to process the data and generate the charts:
    ```bash
    python plotter_all.py
    ```
4. The charts will be generated in the `charts` folder.
5. If you want to regenerate the charts, you can run the script again.
